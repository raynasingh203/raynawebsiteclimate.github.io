            <p><b>Climate change</b> and <b>racism</b> are two of the biggest challenges of the 21st Century. They are also strongly intertwined. There is a stark divide between who has caused climate change and who is suffering its effects. People of colour across the Global South are those who will be most affected by the climate crisis, even though their carbon footprints are generally very low.</p>

    <p><b>Historical and present-day injustices have both left black, indigenous and people-of-colour communities exposed to far greater environmental health hazards than white communities – Veronica Mulenga</b></p>

    <p class="highlight">Environmental Injustice:</p>
    <p class="highlight1"> ✦Environmental injustice exacerbates the impacts of climate change on marginalized communities. This includes disproportionate exposure to pollution, inadequate access to resources for adaptation, and limited decision-making power in climate policies.</p>

    <p>Climate Racism:</p>
    <p>Climate racism refers to the racial disparities in both the causes and consequences of climate change. Marginalized communities, particularly people of color, face systemic barriers in addressing climate challenges, including unequal access to resources, discriminatory policies, and disproportionate impacts of climate-related disasters.</p>

    <p>Effects on Health and Well-being:</p>
    <p>The intersection of climate change and racism has profound effects on health and well-being. Vulnerable communities experience higher rates of respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, mental health issues, and food insecurity due to climate change impacts and environmental racism.</p>

    <p>Policy and Advocacy:</p>
    <p>Addressing climate change and racism requires comprehensive policy measures and advocacy efforts. This includes promoting environmental justice, ensuring equitable access to resources and opportunities for all communities, and amplifying the voices of marginalized groups in climate decision-making processes.</p>
    <p class="highlight">When racism becomes structural, it can operate without obvious intent. There may be no deliberate act of discrimination to find, no "racists" to identify and blame. This is certainly the case with climate change – there is no secret committee of white people plotting to impose climate disaster on the Global South. And yet people of colour still find themselves at a disadvantage, and experience differences in outcomes that are visible in the statistics.</p>
    <p class="highlight1"> ✦ Understanding Structural Racism: The statement highlights the concept of structural racism, which refers to systemic and institutionalized practices that perpetuate racial inequalities and disparities. It prompts us to question how such structures are formed, sustained, and how they operate without overtly malicious intent.
    </p>
    <p>Conclusion:</p>
    <p>In conclusion, addressing the complex interplay between climate change and racism is essential for building a more just and sustainable future. By recognizing and addressing environmental injustice and climate racism, societies can work towards creating equitable and resilient communities for all.</p>
